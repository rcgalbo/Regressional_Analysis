A medical researcher is interested in predicting survival (in days) in patients undergoing a particular type of operation. A random selection of 54 patients was available for analysis. The following information was available for each patient.

X1: Blood clotting score
X2: Prognostic index
X3: Enzyme function test score
X4: Liver function test score
X5: Age in years
X6: Number of years employed
X7: Gender (0 = male, 1 = female)
X8: Moderate alcohol use (1 = yes, 0 = no) 
X9: Severe alcohol use (1 = yes, 0 = no)
 Y: Survival (days)
